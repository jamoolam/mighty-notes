# Objectives

---

# Packages/Dependencies used 

bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

# Things to add and Optimizations

- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 2121 (can be any port example: 3000) 
  - DB_STRING: `your database URI`
 
- I would like to add much more to the application in the future, including but not limited to:
  - An ability for users to edit their inouts after they are submitted
  - Getting images to load properly
  - Beautification of the interface, but unfortunately my design skills leave much to be desired!
